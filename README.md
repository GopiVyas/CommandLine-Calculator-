# 📘 Smart Calculator (Python – Advanced Command-Line Calculator)-
A powerful and flexible command-line calculator built using Python.
Supports normal arithmetic, scientific functions, power operator, ans for previous result, history tracking, and safe expression evaluation.

This is more advanced than a regular CLI calculator and ideal for learning math functions, eval safety, string processing, and command-driven programs.

✨ Features
✔ Basic Arithmetic

Supports:

Addition +

Subtraction -

Multiplication *

Division /

Modulus %

Power operator ^ (converted to ** internally)

✔ Scientific Functions

Use built-in math functions:

sqrt(x)

sin(x)

cos(x)

tan(x)

log(x)

abs(x)

✔ Use Previous Answer

Use ans to reuse the last calculated result:

Enter expression ➤ 10 + 5
Result = 15
Enter expression ➤ ans * 2
Result = 30

✔ Expression Evaluation

Supports:

Parentheses ( )

Nested expressions

Complex formulas

✔ History Tracking

Shows all past calculations on exit.

✔ Safe Evaluation

eval() is sandboxed with:

No built-ins

Only selected math functions

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

math module

String parsing

Secure eval environment
